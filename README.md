# Dev challenge 27

[[https://devchallenges.io/challenge/27]]

This challenge is a great way to start with basic HTML and CSS skills. The challenge is to create a simple blog card that includes an image, a title, a short description, and a tag.

I am challenging my frontend skills until I get better and efficient enough to do tasks like these in my sleep.
